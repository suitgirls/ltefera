            I decided to take this class because Im interested in the technology and engineering feild, and I also thought this would give me a great opportunity to broaden my knowledge in different tecnology based majors
            I am interested in the feild of engineering, spesificaly in the field of Civil and Archatecual engineering, along with the implementaion of technology systems and softwear in those feilds such as CAD design or robotics. 
            I am also supper interested in the feild of Aerospace Engineering, spesificaly in the aspect of space exploration. My long time dream since I was in the fourth grade is to work for NASA as an eginieer and designer for rovers and rockets to mars.

            Outside of school I am known as a someone with a bubbly personality. 
            Ive learned that I am an introverted extrovert; I love being around people and conversing but it more or less takes away energy from me rather than adding.
            I am curious and love learning new things. 
            I like to read, paint, play soccer, and spend time with my firends and family. 
            I am not a morning person but I strive to be, I think waking up early and going to bed early is a healthy habit I try to maintain. 
            I love watching and reading all things mystery, my favorit author is Agitha Christie. I have two younger brothers and a very large extended family. My family is from Ethiopia so we have a very culturaly vibrant home and life.
